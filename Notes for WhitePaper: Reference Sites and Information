The attack involves two hackers, whose radios collect the signals sent between the fob and the car to unlock doors and start engines. 
One hacker carries a radio that collects signals from a target vehicle's fob. This is then passed to an accomplice, as as far away as 
several hundred meters, who uses it to open the doors and start the engine.  They each need to be several meters away from their respective 
targets to harvest the data, but it's possible to use antennas to extend the attack. Any vehicle alarms are rendered redundant, 
as the car trusts the signal.
